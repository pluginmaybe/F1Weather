# F1 Weather App
## An app that shows the weather for this years (2024) F1 circuits
I wanted to practice using APIs and came across a weather one, from openweathermap.org. (Using the free options of current and 5-day forecast - in 3hr chunks)
Figured it'd be fun to use in connection with F1 as a forecast for how chaotic the race weekend may be.

Used dotNet Maui for implementation for its multi-platform capabilities.

Currently, it functions as intended. Click on a circuit and it produces the forecast over the next 5 days for that location.

The circuit details are currently hardcoded into the app, as their doesn't appear to be an API available - could be a future project.
